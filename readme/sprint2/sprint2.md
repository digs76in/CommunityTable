# Sprint 2 (11/14-11/25)

## Forecast

We forecasted we could get **16 story points** done during this sprint. 

The forecast correlated to the second four stories from our [Initial Ordered Product Backlog](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#initial-product-backlog-order):

| __Number__ | __Title__ | __Story Points__ | __Summary__
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | 'About' content | 2 pts | As site owner, I want a page that communicates the mission of Community Table and provides visitors with key information so that they can better understand our vision and know who to contact to get involved. |
| 2. | 'Vision' Page | 3 pts | As site owner, I want a page that communicates the vision of Community Table and provides visitors with information about the future plans and overarching goals of CT. |
| 3. | Admin portal | 8 pts | As an admin I want to log in to an administrative portal so that I can perform functions that should be restricted to admins. |
| 4. | Admin list Member emails | 3 pts | As site owner, I want to be able to communicate to members via the email list, so that I can keep them informed about Community Table. |

## Burndown

Our burndown is based on the completion of each user story's [Sprint Task Checklist](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint1/sprint1.md#acceptance-criteria-and-sprint-tasks) (shown above) which were decomposed from the PBIs committed to the sprint. The last item is always "Meets Definition of Done" ([ref](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#definition-of-done)). 
Subsequently, our Definition of Done has a checklist item for "Acceptance criteria completed" which corresponds to the specific acceptance criteria of each user story (also shown above).

### Impediments

_IRP = Impediment Removal Plan_

#### Shawn - Nov 24th, 12:30 pm
> Need to set up the complete system so I can test logging in to the admin.

IRP: No action needed.

#### Vinod - Nov 22nd, 08:30 pm
> will have to find @keljdoyle time to work together

IRP: Make sure Vinod syncs with Kel to set up time.

#### Kel - Nov 22nd, 08:53 am
> Potentially accessing a test SMTP server

IRP: No action needed.

#### Shawn - Nov 20th, 02:14 pm
> How can I create a new "about" page? Somehow the controller is not matching with the view. I'm guessing the model is off somehow. Can somebody create the basic MVC for an about page, and I'll fill it in with the front-end content? Thanks.

IRP: Answered in Slack.

#### Kel Doyle - Nov 17th, 02:10 pm
> Lack of Docker skillz

IRP: No action needed.

#### Shawn - Nov 15th, 10:58 am
> I think we need to flesh out the expectations of this sprint. Maybe people can look at the backlog and starting adding their names to places where they think they can contribute. Add comments, tasks, and thoughts on the cards. Then when we meet we will have an idea of other people's thoughts and more easily break it down into chunks.

IRP: Discussed in Slack.
