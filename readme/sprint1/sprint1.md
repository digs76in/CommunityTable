# Sprint 1 (10/8-11/11)

## Forecast

We forecasted we could get **21 story points** done during this sprint. Our forecast is primarily based on team member skill levels and technical demands of the actual prioritized PBIs. As this is the first sprint for the Community Tables Scrum Team, we were not sure what our actual velocity would be. Regardless, the forecast accounted for the fact that we each would need to locally configure the project, work through the learning curve of new frameworks, and be able to iterate on our localhost before we were able to begin work on the stories that actually delivered product value. 
The forecast correlated to the first four stories from our [Initial Ordered Product Backlog](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#initial-product-backlog-order):

| __Number__ | __Title__ | __Story Points__ | __Summary__
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Site landing page | 8 pts | As site owner, I want a compelling landing page so that Community Table can be found by people online and they can learn about our mission and services. |
| 2. | Member email signup | 5 pts | As a member I want to register for the Community Table email list so that I can receive news and updates. |
| 3. | Welcome email on Member signup | 5 pts | As site owner, I want members to receive a welcome email when they sign-up, so that they know that we received their email address and so we can provide them with additional Community Table information. |
| 4. | Member unsubscribe email address | 3 pts | As a member, I want emails from CommunityTable to include an unsubscribe link, so I can remove myself from future mailings. |

## Actual

With some strain, we were able to close on all user stories forecasted within the sprint (reference our [Definition of Done](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#definition-of-done)). A summary of [release1](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/README.md#release-1-notes) is is given in the main readme.
Our stakeholders and Scrum Team agree that while release1 is feature complete under sprint1 scope, we will not attempt to deploy into public production until further protections of Mongo and email services are completed -- these are captured as tasks within existing PBIs and are prioritized for sprint2.

### Acceptance Criteria and Sprint Tasks 

1. User Story : _Site landing page_

### Behavior-Driven Development & Unit Tests

We used the [cucumber](https://cucumber.io/) framework to run our Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) tests. Specifically we tested email registration using BDD. See [email_register.feature](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/WebApp/src/test/java/features/email_register.feature), [EmailRegisterStepdefs](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/WebApp/src/test/java/stepdefs/EmailRegisterStepdefs.java), and the screenshot below (showing all tests passed).

Our unit tests (used JUnit) are shown below.

## Burndown

Our burndown is based on the completion of each user story's [Sprint Task Checklist](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint1/sprint1.md#acceptance-criteria-and-sprint-tasks) (shown above) which were decomposed from the PBIs committed to the sprint. The last item is always "Meets Definition of Done" ([ref](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#definition-of-done)). 
Subsequently, our Definition of Done has a checklist item for "Acceptance criteria completed" which corresponds to the specific acceptance criteria of each user story (also shown above).

## Sprint Review and Retrospective

We conducted our sprint review with stakeholders and Scrum Team retrospective 13 NOV. 

### Stakeholder Feeback

Our primary stakeholder is pleased with the progress and completeness of our efforts. She offered the following feedback, mostly looking towards the next sprint:

- stakeholder offered additional custom content for both the landing page and welcome email (both of which are built for easy [Content Customization](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint1/site_template.png)).
- when stakeholder deploys our release public (after security tasks and admin portal are completed, estimated for release2), stakeholder wants naming convention `elizabethton.communitytabletn.com` for hosting her configured site.
- stakeholder requests that we assist her in setting up her public site and help her sort through hosting options. 
- stakeholder wants to name the blog 'Table Talk' (estimated for release2).
- stakeholder wants blogs to be rendered on her Community Table TN site to show summary with image and abstract and a link to expand to read all.
- stakeholder wants to make the blog friendly for publishing to Facebook, e.g. url for each blog, Facebook able to show summary with image and abstract.

This feedback will be absorbed into the product backlog (and groomed) ahead of sprint 2 planning.
 
### Scrum Team Retrospective

While the retrospective is a generally closed door event, we chose to share these highlights:

- It took longer to get up and running across the team due to the cold-start (i.e. first sprint with no legacy to build upon) and range of technologies (reference [Product Iteration Details](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/README.md#product-iteration-oct-dec-2016)) 
- Spring MVC framework has a rather steep learning curve. More pinpointed documentation for features we are using would really help.
- Any changes should be communicated clearly to the team so everyone understands what is happening.
- We will shift to all development undertaken first within feature branches, then submitted by pull request for review and acceptance or modification. This procedural change will go far to address the feedback to communicate changes and will further enforce our two-eyes minimum code review prior as part of our  [Definition of Done](https://github.com/michaeljohns2/CommunityTable/blob/master/readme/sprint0/sprint0.md#definition-of-done). 
- We need to maintain tighter communication accross the team, especially in the final days of the sprint. We will solicit commitments for responsiveness on Slack at our next team meeting.
